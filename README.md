# Integrated Project Delivery Model For Collaborative Contracting
#### Bokeh App hosted on heroku, high level model of an IPD framework to provide a understanding of the basic premise.

##### Premise & Caveats
We wanted to create a graphical representation of how an IPD model could work at a high level. This model makes a lot of assumptions about scope split, equal profit sharing and the target cost. These are all details that would have to be discussed and agreed upon before an IPD framework could be put in place.

However we believe that a high level graphical model such as this can be a useful tool for understanding how various scenarios may drive behavior. In addition, as details are discussed the source code of the model can be updated to build a more comprehensive picture tailored to your project.

Again, the values shown here are high level estimates and the same can be said for the scope splits. The whole model should be treated as indicative (what a model could look like, not what it will).
